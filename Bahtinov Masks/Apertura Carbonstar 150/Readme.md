# Tri-Bahtinov Mask for Apertura Carbonstar 150 newtonian astrograph
### For field checking and adjusting primary mirror collimation



Print in ASA or ABS for best results. Magnets are a tight press fit, I attached them to the end of a 1'4" ot 6mm Allen key, applied a bit of superglue to the magnet and drove them in.  Pay careful attention to the orientation as the magnet in the blocknig mask shoutl attract the magnets in the bahtinov mask. Optional: A small piece of gaffers or duct tape 6mmx8mm can be placed inside to he rim of the Bahtinov mask to prevent it rotating on the telescope aperture. 

This mask is designed to fit over the aperture of the carbonstar with arrows lined up with collimation screws at the back of the telescope. Collimation using this mask is for primary mirror only and assumes that the rest of your optical train is already in good alignment. Initial collimation is checked by focusing on a bright star such as Vega with just the Bahtinov mask installed on the aperture of the telescope. All of the diffraction spikes should be evenly spaced. Adjustments are made by placing the blocking mask over the Bahtinov mask, turn until the magnet registers over the axis that you want to adjust, take another exposure and make small adjustments until the diffraction spikes are centered. repeat for all three axes until collimation is acheived.
